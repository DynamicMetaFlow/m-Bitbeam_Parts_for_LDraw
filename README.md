## What is Bitbeam?
_Basic Info from [Bitbeam Repository] (https://github.com/bitbeam/bitbeam/wiki/The-Bitbeam-project):_

[Bitbeam] (http://bitbeam.org) is an open source construction toy/hardware prototyping platform. A collection of LEGO Technic compatible parts (beams) which can be combined to construct whatever contraption the user has thought up.

The Bitbeam project aims to define a set of parts which the users themselves can produce using increasingly available technologies for local fabrication like 3D printers, laser cutters and CNC mills.

The name for the project is derived from the full size modular building system [Grid Beam](http://gridbeamers.com) (Formerly Box Beam).

## Why m-Bitbeam?

m-Bitbeam is an extended Bitbeam 3D printable set that we use when teaching children (STEM education). For more information, see the section of 3D models of the magazine [e-Mole](http://www.e-mole.cz/3d-model/seznam) (yet Czech only). All models are free to download :-)
